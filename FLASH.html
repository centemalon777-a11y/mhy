  { question: "What is Speed?", answer: "Speed is the distance covered per unit time. SI unit: m/s" },
  { question: "What is Velocity?", answer: "Velocity is displacement per unit time in a specified direction." },
  { question: "Newton’s First Law?", answer: "A body remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted on by an external force." },
  { question: "SI Unit of Force?", answer: "The SI unit of force is Newton (N)." },
  { question: "What is Work?", answer: "Work = Force × Distance (in the direction of force). SI unit: Joule (J)." },
  { question: "What is Power?", answer: "Power is the rate of doing work. SI unit: Watt (W)." },
  { question: "What is Energy?", answer: "Energy is the ability to do work. SI unit: Joule (J)." },

  { question: "What is Temperature?", answer: "Temperature measures the degree of hotness. SI unit: Kelvin (K)." },
  { question: "What is Reflection of Light?", answer: "Reflection is the bouncing back of light from a surface." },
  { question: "What is Refraction of Light?", answer: "Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another." },
  { question: "What is Sound?", answer: "Sound is a form of energy produced by vibrating objects. It travels as a longitudinal wave." },
  { question: "What is Electric Current?", answer: "Electric current is the flow of electric charge. SI unit: Ampere (A)." },
  { question: "What is Magnetism?", answer: "Magnetism is a force of attraction or repulsion due to moving electric charges." },
  { question: "What is Elasticity?", answer: "Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its original shape after deformation." },
  { question: "What is a Simple Machine?", answer: "A simple machine is a device that makes work easier, e.g., lever, pulley, inclined plane." }
