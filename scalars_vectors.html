    <p>SS1 Physics ‚Äì Comprehensive Notes</p>
  </header>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In physics, quantities are classified into two main groups: <b>scalars</b> and <b>vectors</b>. 
  Understanding the difference between them is essential, because it determines how we calculate and represent physical quantities.</p>

  <h2>Scalar Quantities</h2>
  <p>A <b>scalar quantity</b> has only magnitude (size or value) but no direction. Scalars are represented by ordinary numbers.</p>
  <p><b>Examples of Scalars:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mass (kg)</li>
    <li>Time (seconds)</li>
    <li>Speed (m/s)</li>
    <li>Temperature (¬∞C or K)</li>
    <li>Energy (Joule)</li>
    <li>Distance (meters)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
    Example: If a car travels at a speed of 50 km/h, the value "50 km/h" is a scalar because it has no direction.
  </div>

  <h2>Vector Quantities</h2>
  <p>A <b>vector quantity</b> has both magnitude and direction. Vectors are usually represented by arrows. 
  The length of the arrow shows the magnitude, and the arrowhead shows the direction.</p>
  <p><b>Examples of Vectors:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Velocity (m/s in a given direction)</li>
    <li>Displacement (meters in a direction)</li>
    <li>Acceleration (m/s¬≤ in a direction)</li>
    <li>Force (Newtons in a direction)</li>
    <li>Momentum (kg¬∑m/s in a direction)</li>
    <li>Weight (force due to gravity, acts downward)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
    Example: If a car moves at 50 km/h north, that is a vector because both magnitude (50 km/h) and direction (north) are given.
  </div>

  <h2>Representation of Vectors</h2>
  <p>Vectors can be represented by arrows on a diagram. The arrow length is proportional to the magnitude, and the arrow points in the required direction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Symbolically, vectors are written in bold (e.g., <b>F</b>) or with an arrow above (e.g., <b>‚ÜíF</b>).</li>
    <li>Scalars are written in italics (e.g., <i>m</i>, <i>t</i>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Vector Addition</h2>
  <p>When two or more vectors are combined, the process is called <b>vector addition</b>. Common methods include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Triangle (Head-to-tail) method</b>: Place the tail of one vector at the head of the other. The resultant vector is drawn from the tail of the first to the head of the last.</li>
    <li><b>Parallelogram method</b>: Place both vectors from a common origin and complete the parallelogram. The diagonal represents the resultant vector.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Vector Resolution</h2>
  <p>A single vector can be resolved into two perpendicular components (usually horizontal and vertical). 
  This is useful in analyzing forces, projectile motion, and inclined planes.</p>
  <div class="formula">
    If a vector F makes an angle Œ∏ with the horizontal:<br>
    Horizontal component Fx = F cosŒ∏<br>
    Vertical component Fy = F sinŒ∏
  </div>

  <h2>Key Differences Between Scalars and Vectors</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Scalars have only magnitude; vectors have both magnitude and direction.</li>
    <li>Scalars are added algebraically; vectors require geometric or trigonometric methods.</li>
    <li>Examples of scalars: mass, time, temperature. Examples of vectors: force, velocity, acceleration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The distinction between scalars and vectors forms the basis for understanding mechanics, motion, and forces. 
  Mastering vector addition and resolution is essential for solving many physics problems.</p>
