    <p>SS1 Physics – Comprehensive Notes</p>
  </header>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Everything around us – the air we breathe, the water we drink, the chair we sit on – is made of matter. 
  Physics studies the physical properties of matter, its behavior, and how it interacts with forces and energy.</p>

  <h2>States of Matter</h2>
  <p>Matter exists in different forms called states. The three classical states are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Solid:</b> Has definite shape and volume. Particles are closely packed and vibrate in fixed positions (e.g., ice, wood, iron).</li>
    <li><b>Liquid:</b> Has definite volume but takes the shape of its container. Particles are close but can slide over each other (e.g., water, oil, milk).</li>
    <li><b>Gas:</b> Has neither definite shape nor volume. Particles are far apart and move freely in all directions (e.g., oxygen, carbon dioxide).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Beyond these, scientists have discovered other states like plasma and Bose-Einstein condensates, but in SS1 Physics, focus is on solids, liquids, and gases.</p>

  <h2>Structure of Matter</h2>
  <p>Matter is made up of <b>tiny particles</b> known as atoms and molecules. Atoms combine to form molecules. These particles are so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye but their existence is supported by evidence such as diffusion and Brownian motion.</p>

  <h2>Evidence for the Particle Nature of Matter</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Diffusion:</b> The gradual mixing of particles of one substance with another (e.g., fragrance spreading in a room).</li>
    <li><b>Brownian Motion:</b> The continuous, random motion of tiny particles suspended in a fluid, caused by collisions with smaller, invisible particles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Properties of Matter</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Matter has <b>mass</b>.</li>
    <li>Matter occupies <b>space</b>.</li>
    <li>Particles of matter are in <b>constant motion</b>.</li>
    <li>There are <b>intermolecular forces</b> between particles.</li>
    <li>There are <b>spaces</b> between particles of matter.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes of State</h2>
  <p>Matter can change from one state to another through the addition or removal of heat energy. These processes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Melting:</b> Solid → Liquid (e.g., ice melting to water).</li>
    <li><b>Freezing:</b> Liquid → Solid (e.g., water turning into ice).</li>
    <li><b>Evaporation:</b> Liquid → Gas (occurs at the surface, below boiling point).</li>
    <li><b>Boiling:</b> Liquid → Gas (occurs throughout the liquid at boiling temperature).</li>
    <li><b>Condensation:</b> Gas → Liquid.</li>
    <li><b>Sublimation:</b> Solid ↔ Gas without passing through liquid (e.g., iodine, camphor).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Importance of Studying Matter</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Helps us understand natural phenomena.</li>
    <li>Forms the foundation for chemistry, biology, and engineering.</li>
    <li>Explains the behavior of materials under different conditions.</li>
    <li>Leads to inventions like refrigerators, air conditioners, and scientific instruments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The study of matter is the foundation of physics. By understanding matter, its states, and its behavior, we can better explain the physical world and create useful applications that improve human life.</p>
